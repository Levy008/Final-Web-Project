the webpage provided for question 1 from the web dev test. Question 2 and 3 answers will be 
provided in the web-DEv-Test.pdf file and the questions are as follows below :

## 1. Question 01
The images are not provided and you don’t need to create them, you can freely use images
from the web.
Bonus points:
Nice look/branding colors
JavaScript for the navigation menu on the sidebar
Well written code


## 2. Question 02:
When you visit a page, you'll see the following:
In the HTML syntax, there is a tag that allows an element to be displayed on the screen, which
corresponds to the URL https://helpjuice.com/, exclusively when clicking on the picture
associated with the question, named HELPJUICE.PNG
Upon clicking on Copyright © 2024, Helpjuice Inc. nothing happens.
When the user hovers over the image, the mouse pointer changes, indicating that there is a link
to another page. However, the same thing does not happen when the user hovers over the
sentence below the image.
Taking the statements above into consideration, choose the correct HTML fragment:
```
● A) <h1><a href='https://helpjuice.com/'><img src='HELPJUICE.PNG'
alt='Helpjuice'><br>Copyright © 2024, Helpjuice Inc.</a></h1>
● B) <h1><a href='https://helpjuice.com/'><img src='HELPJUICE.PNG'
alt='Helpjuice'><br></a>Copyright © 2024, Helpjuice Inc.</h1>
● C) <h1><a href='https://helpjuice.com/'><img img='HELPJUICE.PNG'
alt='Helpjuice'><br></a>Copyright © 2024, Helpjuice Inc.</h1>
● D) <h1><img src='HELPJUICE.PNG' alt='Helpjuice'><a
href='https://helpjuice.com/'><br>Copyright © 2024, Helpjuice Inc.</a></h1>
E) <h1><img src='HELPJUICE.PNG' alt='Helpjuice'><br><a
href='https://helpjuice.com/'>Copyright © 2024, Helpjuice Inc.</a></h1>
```
